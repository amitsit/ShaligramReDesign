                <h2 class="pageHeading">What is Trademark Registration?</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Basically, a Trademark is a “brand” or “logo” that you can use to distinguish your product from those of your competitors. It deters piracy and prevents similar company names from being registered by other businesses. For e.g. the logo of NIKE and their tagline JUST DO IT is a registered trademark. It provides them protection as it is illegal to use the same logo or tagline.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">A registered trademark is an intangible asset for a business and is used to protect the company’s investment in the brand or symbol. In India, you could get a ™ within three days, but it takes up to two years for it to be registered so that you can use the ® symbol. It is always advised to get trademark registration because getting your company registered will not protect your brand against those who might initiate using identical or similar marks.</p>
                <h2 class="pageHeading">6 Essential Facts on Trademark</h2>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>What is a trademark?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">A trademark is any unique expression related to a product or service that distinguishes it from others. A trademark can be a visual symbol, which may be a word, a name, a device, label or numerals used by a business to distinguish it from other goods of different business.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>How long does it take?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">The trademark registration application process is done almost instantly. It can be done within a few hours of you giving us your Authorization Letter. After we make the application, the government takes almost 18 to 24 months to confirm the registration and give you the confirmed Registration Certificate for your trademark. You can then use the ® symbol next to your name.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>What do I need to provide?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Once they receive the authorisation letter & provided that no information is incorrect or partial, our lawyers will file the trademark on your behalf, and you can immediately start using the ™ symbol. They will provide you with the TM application number. They file the trademark different at the central trademark department office or via online. A trademark can be filed online only by a registered lawyer or agent.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Is my trademark available?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">We can do a trademark search for you, if you have a certain brand name, or a logo, or a slogan in mind. A simple way to do this yourself, is to just go online to the internet and check if there is a company with the name similar to yours, on the internet. You should also check for the availability of the domain name of your brand.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>What if the trademark is taken?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">There is no need to worry if your trademark brand name is taken, you can simply prepare a Logo Composite Mark by combining your logo and your name, and apply as one. This is the most common strategy used to apply for a trademark, even if the trade name itself has been taken.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Who owns a trademark?</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">A trademark grants you commercial rights to sell a particular brand name in a certain sector of the economy. The Trademark Registry has classified goods and services under 45 classes. Your application must mention the class/classes of the goods/services. The trademark would be registered under those classes only.</p>
                </div>


                <h2 class="pageHeading">Advantages of Trademark Registration</h2>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Business Opportunity</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">A trademark is an intangible asset that can be enormously valuable, should your brand succeed. Think of Tide, Nike or McDonald's. Businesses can earn huge money in royalties through licensing agreements or even transfer ownership to interested parties through assignment agreements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Unique Identity</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">One of the best qualities of trademark registration is that it helps you to establish a unique identity of your company. And no other competitor can apply or use your trademark for similar goods or services.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="essential">
                    <h4>Legal Protection</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">You become the legal owner of the registered trademark and no another person has the right to use your registered trademark without your prior permission. No action can be taken against a 2nd party if the trademark is not registered with the government. The registered trademark holder can take some legal action against anyone who tries to copy the trademark with any prior permission.</p>

                            <p class="panel-body">Before settling on a brand name, you need to check if it can acquire the legal rights necessary to hold on it. This is because the commercial rights to a brand name belong to the owner of its trademark. To find out if yours has already been taken, you can run a trademark search, which is basically a database search of India’s Intellectual Property Database. Now, running the search is easy. Begin by selecting the wordmark and typing in the word/s you want to register. The results will tell you whether there already is another registration in that name.</p>
                            <p class="panel-body">If there is one, check its status. If it is either approved, applied, objected or opposed, it makes sense to pick another name. Do also check for phonetic similarities with other registered names. To do this, you need to select the dropdown at the top of the page. While the phonetic search isn’t very accurate, you can say with certainty that your trademark will be approved if there aren’t any relevant matches here either.</p>

                            <p class="panel-body">The Trademark Registry has classified goods and services under 45 classes. The class/classes of the goods/services should be mentioned accurately in an application. The trademark would be registered under those classes only. When doing trademark search you should only be worried if a trademark with a similar name exists in the same class. For example, if you are an IT provider by name of ComSys, you will get your trademark if someone else has registered the same trademark in some other class.</p>

                            <p class="panel-body">You can't get the word, but all is not lost. Instead you can design a unique logo for your business and include the name in it. Take BMW as an example. The BMW is within the logo. A prefix would also be permissible. This is known as a logo composite mark. So there is a way out, but it is best to have a unique name.</p>

This, therefore, includes your brand name, logo or slogan. New brands need only bother themselves with these three types, though more successful brands, that have much more to protect, trademark much else. Levis, for example, has trademarked the position of its red label on all its jeans. Cadbury’s fought hard to maintain exclusive rights to use the colour purple on packaging for chocolate, but ultimately lost the dispute with Nestle. Young start-ups, however, tend only to trademark a word or logo or else register a logo composite mark (when text is included within the logo).</p>

If there is no opposition from other businesses in the next four months, your trademark is registered around six months later.
